# React Native: Unexpected Prop Type Error in Asynchronous Operations

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native: the 'Unexpected prop type' error when dealing with asynchronous data fetching.  The error arises when a component renders before the expected prop data is available, resulting in an unexpected type (often null or undefined) being passed to the component.

## Problem
The `bug.js` file shows an example of how this error manifests. The `MyComponent` expects a specific prop, but this data might not always be immediately available.  Incorrect usage leads to the 'Unexpected prop type' error.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` provides the solution by using the `useEffect` hook with a conditional rendering to handle the loading state and prevent rendering the component until the necessary data is available. This ensures the component receives the expected prop type, preventing the error.
